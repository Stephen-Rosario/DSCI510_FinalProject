DSCI-510 Final Project

# Student Performance Predictor

This project is part of USC DSCI-510 and aims to predict student academic performance using a combination of individual-level student data and country-level education statistics. The goal is to understand which micro- and macro-level factors contribute most to student success and to identify students at risk of underperforming.

## Project Overview

We use the UCI Student Performance Dataset (math and Portuguese tracks) and enrich it with World Bank indicators including:
- Government Expenditure on Education (% of GDP)
- Tertiary Enrollment (% gross)

The merged dataset is used to train classification and regression models to predict final grades and pass/fail outcomes.
